# Build a multi-tasking asssistant with Azure OpenAI

This instructions are for participants of the Workshop "Build a multi-tasking asssistant with Azure OpenAI" at Microsoft AI Tour 2024-2025.

!!! note "Microsoft AI Tour 2024 Registration Is Live"

    The workshop is offered as an **instructor-led** session (WRK551) on the **Prototype to Production** track:

    > In this workshop attendees will be introduced to the concept of Agents, an approach in AI that combines thought and action using LLMs and tools to achieve a desired goal. The sample presented will demonstrates how to create a Python app that takes a topic and instruction from a user then calls a research agent that uses the Bing Search API to research the topic, a product agent that uses Azure AI Search to do a semantic similarity search for related products from a vector store, a writer agent to combine the research and product information into a helpful article, and an editor agent to refine the article that's finally presented to the user. 

    - [**Register to attend**](https://aitour.microsoft.com/) at a tour stop near you.
    - [**View Lab resources**](https://aka.ms/aitour/wrk551) to continue your journey.

## Pre-Requisites

To participate in this workshop, you will need:

1. Your own laptop.
   * It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces, so almost any laptop will do.
   * A recent version of Edge, Chrome or Safari is recommended.
2. A GitHub Account.
   * If you don't have one, you can [signup for a free account](https://github.com/signup) now.
   * After this workshop is complete, you will have a fork of the "contoso-chat" repository in your GitHub account, which includes all the materials you will need to reproduce this workshop at home.
3. Familiarity with Visual Studio Code. 
   * We will run all code in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine, instead of your local laptop. We won't be running anything on your laptop directly.
   * VS Code Online will be our development environment in GitHub Codespaces.
   * If you are familiar with running Codespaces within VS Code Desktop on your laptop, feel free to do so. 
4. (preferred) Familiarity with the `bash` shell. 
    * We'll be using `bash` to run commands in the VS Code terminal.

## Get Started

To get started you will need to follow the instructions in the Skillable Lab Manual in the Skillable environment. After following these instructions you should have succesfully launched a Codespace for the [conotoso-creative-writer](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer) repository on your own branch. You can preview the Skillable Lab Manual instructions in this repository by veiwing them [here](./train-the-trainer/LAB_MANUAL.md)

## Continue the workshop

In your Codespace, use the VS Code Online File Explorer on the left to go to the folder `docs\workshop` and open the `README` file.


Follow the instructions in that file to continue.
