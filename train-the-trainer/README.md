## Deployment / Preparation

There are two parts of this lab the participants will need to complete for succesful deployment: 

1. Pre-requisites, getting Azure Credentials, and launching Github Codepsaces using the instructions in the Skillable Lab Manual

    * This part of the workshop should be completed during the `DEMO and Lab Manual walk through` section of the workshop, after you show a quick demo of what the final deployed app should look like. You can read the [Skillable Lab Manual](LAB_MANUAL.md) for this workshop in this repository but on the day you should open it in the Skillable environment. 

    * The instructor should share their screen and walk through the Skillable Lab Manual Instructions in the Skillable environment and instruct the participants to follow along doing the same on their own machines. 

    * Once the majority of participants have launched their Github Codespace environment you should discuss the `How does the assitant work?` and `Workshop Goals` sections from the slides while the Codespaces loads. 

    * We will not be using the Skillable VM for the workshop but participants will need to get their Azure credentials from the Skillable `Resources` tab. 

    * Skillable will have already provisioned the workshop resources, however participants will be instructed in the lab manual to download an env file with their environment variables in it. (Read the Skillable Lab Manual for Pre-requisites and details.)

2.   Following the self paced instructions in the [contoso-chat-writer](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer) repository

    * Instructions for this part of the workshop will be in the `./docs/workshop` folder of the repository. 

    * Participants should complete this section without need for guidance from the instructors, however please help if a participant is stuck.  


## Demos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There is:
    * one pre-recorded video of the completed app 
    * one pre-recorded app walking through the lab manual instructions (you should walk through the lab instructions yourself with participants but the video is to guide you and in case of technical difficulties). 
You will actively present these two demos in the workshop during the `DEMO and Lab Manual walk through` section. 

We have also included a complete walkthrough of the entire workshop for your convinience. 
Before the workshop it is important for you to login to skillable and ensure that you are able to follow the instructions in the manual. If not please reach out to the content creators for help.
